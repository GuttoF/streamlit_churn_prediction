# Streamlit Churn Prediction App

## Overview

This application combines the power of the knapsack problem and a machine learning model to create simulations that showcase churn reduction, return on investment (ROI), and the impact on the number of clients returned.

## Features

- **Knapsack Problem Simulation:** Utilize the knapsack problem to optimize resource allocation, reflecting real-world scenarios where limited resources must be strategically allocated.
  
- **Machine Learning Model Integration:** The app seamlessly integrates a machine learning model designed to predict and reduce churn, allowing users to explore the potential impact of predictive analytics on customer retention.

- **ROI Visualization:** Understand the return on investment by visualizing the financial gains achieved through the simulation. Analyze how strategic decisions impact the bottom line.

- **Client Retention Analysis:** Explore and analyze the simulated scenarios to observe how different strategies influence the number of clients who return, providing valuable insights for customer relationship management.
